If you're looking to personalize your blog further, here are some tips:

1. **Use custom favicons**: Follow the directions [here](https://chirpy.cotes.page/posts/customize-the-favicon/#download--replace).
- The favicons for this site were generated by Stable Diffusion, which I will cover in another post.
2. **Create new/customize tabs**: Very simply, go under the `_tabs` folder in your blog repo, and duplicate one of the existing markdown files. Each tab has an associated markdown file with it's name, e.g. `about.md` for the About tab. Edit the [front matter](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/front-matter/) so the tabs have the order you want. Then you can add in your own text and content as you wish. For example, I added a resume section with a PDF copy of my resume.
3. **Update the profile photo**: This setting can be found under the `_config.yml` file under `avatar: '/commons/avatar.jpg'`. Change `'/commons/avatar.jpg'` to the location of your desired photo. The profile photo I chose is of myself but generated from Stable Diffusion, again a post for another time.
4. **Update the contact methods**: This setting can be found under the `_data` folder in the `contact.yml` file. Uncomment whichever additional methods of contact you want to provide.
That's it for now! A few fairly easy modifications that will make your blog feel more authenitcally yours.
